# Simple example to get started with Nordic's SDKs in CLion
This is a simple example showing you how to setup and configure CLion and get started with Nordic's SDKs. It only shows how to do it in Windows and only the basic setps. 

# You'll need:
* [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).
* [TDM-GCC compiler](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/).
* [SDK from Nordic](http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRF52-DK/nRF5-SDK-zip/54283). I used SDK V11.
